    Historically, the vault key manager backend converts its managed objects
    to dictionaries in order to send them as a json object.  To promote
    cross-backend compatibility, suck feature should be migrated to managed
    objects.  Methods from_dict() and to_dict() added to class ManagedObject.
    The Method from_dict() is a class method to create instances based on a
    dictionary while the method to_dict() is an instance method to translate
    an instance to a dictionary.
