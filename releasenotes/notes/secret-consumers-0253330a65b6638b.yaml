    The Barbican API has been extended to allow secrets to have one or
    more consumers.  This extension has been documented here:
    https://docs.openstack.org/barbican/latest/api/reference/secret_consumers.html

    This functionality has now been exposed in the castellan client.
    Users may add, remove or delete consumers by calling new mechods on the
    SecretManager.  Note that this functionality is only available for
    the Barbican backend.
