    Enhance the global option listing to discover available key managers and
    their options. The purpose of this feature is to have a correct listing of
    the supported key managers, now each key manager is responsible for
    advertising the oslo.config groups/options they consume.
other:
  - |
    The visibility of module variables and constants related to oslo.config
    options changed to private in both barbican and vault key managers. The
    key managers are only responsible for overloading the method
    list_options_for_discovery() in order to advertise their own options.
    This way, the global options doesn't need to know which variables to look
    for.
