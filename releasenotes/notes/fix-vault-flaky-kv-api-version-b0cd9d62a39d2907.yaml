    In some situations, vault will not provide KV API version in the options
    structure. Vault documentation [1] doesn't cover cases when KV API version
    is not provided. A new configuration option, with default value equivalent
    to the latest KV API version available (kv_version=2) was added to allow
    precise configuration of the KV API being used.
